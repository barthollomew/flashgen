IMPORTANT: To use ChatGPT, you'll need an API key from OpenAI. Replace YOUR_API_KEY in summarize_text.py with your actual API key. Sign up for an account at https://beta.openai.com/signup/ to obtain your API key. 


```bash

How to use:

1. Place the PDF files (PowerPoint/lecture slides) you want to extract text from in a directory, e.g., pdf_files.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder containing the Python scripts
3. Run using main.py
4. Enter your OpenAI API key and the directory containing PDF files to process.
5. Choose an option: summarize text, create flashcards, or do both. 
  - If summarizing, call chat_gpt_summarise to generate summaries using the OpenAI API and save them in the 'summaries' directory.
  - If creating flashcards, call generate_flashcards to generate flashcards using the OpenAI API and save them as CSV files in the 'flashcards' directory.
  - If doing both, program first summarize the text, and then generates the flashcards from the summaries.
